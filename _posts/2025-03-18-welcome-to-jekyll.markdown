## Understanding Social Data Through Visualization

In this post, we introduce an interactive visualization that explores key insights from our social data analysis assignment. The data focuses on [briefly describe what the data representsâ€”e.g., social media trends, demographic insights, sentiment analysis, etc.].

### **Why Visualization Matters**
Data visualizations help reveal patterns and insights that are not immediately apparent in raw data. By using interactive tools like **Bokeh**, we can dynamically explore relationships and trends within our dataset.

Below is an interactive graph generated using **Bokeh**:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
    <iframe src="/assets/interactive_plot.html" width="700px" height="400px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
</div>


### **How to Interact with the Graph**
- **Hover over points** to see additional information.
- **Zoom in/out** to focus on specific data points.
- **Pan across the graph** to navigate trends.

This visualization is part of our ongoing analysis for **[Course Name or Project Name]**, where we use **Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Bokeh** to explore real-world social data.

## Next Steps
In future posts, we will dive deeper into the methodology, data sources, and how we can extend these visualizations to gain even more insights.
